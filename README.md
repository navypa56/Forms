HTML HPI & Exam Form that generates data which you can copy and paste into notes as text.

This is a work in progress, i am constantly looking for errors and functionality issues as i'm new to coding.

I am not writing code (no idea how) i use large language model AIs to generate a base code then i use Cursor AI to make it dynamic.

Even absent having to write code it's still quite a painful process to get things exactly how one wants.

If you find any errors or want a condition added, etc. please let me know.



Click the html file and you will see the code and the far right is a download button to download the form to a folder, you have to do the same for the JSON file as the HTML form uses the JSON file to create different notes for different common conditions in each category.
