# Forms
HTML HPI & Exam Form that generates data which you can copy and paste into notes as text.

You must save the HTML file and the JSON file into the same folder as the HTML form uses the JSON file to create different notes for common conditions.

This is a work in progress, i am constantly looking for errors and functionality issues as i'm new to coding.

I am not writing i use large language model AIs to generat a base code then i use Cursor AI to make it dynamic.

Even absent having to write code it's still quite a painful process to get things exactly how one wants.

If you find any errors or want a condition added, etc. please let me know.
